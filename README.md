<h1>Building-a-Customer-Onboarding-App</h1>
In your first capstone, you are a cloud application developer working for AnyCompany Bank. The bank has decided to develop and deploy a customer onboarding application on AWS. During customer onboarding, there is a significant exchange of information between AnyCompany Bank and customers. 

<h2>Description</h2>
Customer onboarding is one of the most important stages of a customerâ€™s journey with a bank. During this stage, the bank and customers exchange significant information. This exchange involves obtaining documentation needed to meet regulatory requirements and provide relevant products and services to customers.

AnyCompany Bank has decided to develop and deploy a customer onboarding serverless application on AWS. With the proposed customer onboarding solutions on AWS, the bank can use artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and digital tools to streamline the onboarding process. With these solutions, the bank can transform the ways that customers are onboarded and reduce friction during this essential process.

As a cloud developer at AnyCompany Bank, you have been assigned the task of building the new onboarding application on AWS. The application is named Know Your Customer (KYC).

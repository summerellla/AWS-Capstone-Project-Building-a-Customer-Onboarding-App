~<h2>Description</h2>
~In your first capstone, you are a cloud application developer working for AnyCompany Bank. The bank has decided to develop and deploy a customer onboarding application on AWS. During customer onboarding, there is a significant exchange of information between AnyCompany Bank and customers. Customer onboarding allows AnyCompany Bank to obtain documentation to meet regulatory requirements and provide relevant products and services to customers. Your task is to help AnyCompany Bank build a customer onboarding application on AWS. With the proposed customer onboarding solution on AWS, AnyCompany Bank can use artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and digital tools to streamline the onboarding process. With these solutions, AnyCompany Bank can transform how they onboard customers and reduce friction during this essential process.
